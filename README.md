# Test Framework

This repository contains a **comprehensive test automation framework** built using **Java**, **Selenium**, **TestNG**, and **RestAssured**. It supports both **frontend** and **backend** testing, providing a solid foundation for automated test development.

## Key Features

- **Frontend Testing** with Selenium WebDriver
- **Backend Testing** with RestAssured for API validation
- **TestNG** for test orchestration and reporting
- **Allure Reporting** for detailed and interactive test reports
- **Jenkins Integration** for continuous integration and automated test execution

## Framework Overview

This framework comes with a preconfigured **skeleton** for basic test scenarios, both for **web UI** and **REST API**. Itâ€™s designed to be scalable, making it easy to extend with additional tests as needed.

- **Web Testing**: Test automation for modern web applications using Selenium.
- **API Testing**: Ensure backend API reliability and accuracy with RestAssured.
- **Test Reporting**: Gain insights with clear, interactive reports using Allure.
- **Continuous Integration**: Seamless integration with Jenkins for automated execution and reporting.

## Setup
